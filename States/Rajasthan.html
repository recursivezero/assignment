    History
    Ghoomar is of Bhil tribe performed to worship goddess Sarasvati which was later embraced by other Rajasthani communities.[1][2][3][4][5] Bheels were a strong community at that time and were in constant war with Rajput kings. After much fighting peace was made and they began interacting with each other. Ghoomar was performed at Rajputana by local women, later on Rajput elite women also started participating in the dance. Men were not allowed at these dance performances. Ghoomar became popular in the Indian state of Rajasthan during the reigns of Rajput kings, and is typically performed by women during auspicious occasions.[1] Women perform ghoomar with ghoonghat on their head covering their face. The dance form acquires different style and slight change in attire with the different regions of Rajasthan. Ghoomar is performed with faster beats in areas adjoining Gujarat, steps similar to garba style, while slower beats in Dhaulpur Karauli Braj kshetra, similarly difference in attire and dancing style can be seen in Udaipur, Kota, Bundi etc.</p>
