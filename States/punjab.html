  <img src="images\punjab.jpg" alt="Bhangra Dance" width="400">
  <p>Bhangra is an energetic dance traditionally performed by farmers in Punjab to celebrate the harvest season. It is known for its powerful, rhythmic moves.Bhangra is a type of traditional folk dance of Punjab area of the Indian subcontinent.[1] It is done in the season of harvesting. According to Manuel (2001), bhangra is especially associated with the vernal Vaisakhi festival, performed during harvest season between April and the first quarter of May.[2]

    In a typical performance, several dancers execute vigorous kicks, leaps, and bends of the body—often with upraised, thrusting arm or shoulder movements—to the accompaniment of short songs called boliyan and, most significantly, to the beat of a dhol (double-headed drum).[3] Struck with a heavy beater on one end and with a lighter stick on the other, the dhol imbues the music with a syncopated (accents on the weak beats), swinging rhythmic character that has generally remained the hallmark of bhangra music.[4] An energetic Punjabi dance, bhangra originated with Punjabi farmers as a cultural and communal celebration; its modern-day evolution has allowed bhangra to retain its traditional Punjabi roots, while broadening its reach to include integration into popular music and DJing, group-based competitions, and even exercise[3] and dance programs in schools and studios.[4]
    
    Origin
    The dance has origins from the Sangrur district of Malwa and Sialkot, Gurdaspur, Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Shekhupura districts of Majha,[5][6] with the Sialkot variant regarded as the standard.[7] The community form of traditional bhangra has been maintained in Gurdaspur,[8] where farmers performed bhangra to showcase a sense of accomplishment and to welcome the new harvesting season in pre-partition times,[8] and has been maintained by people who have settled in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India.[5] Traditional bhangra is performed in a circle[9] and is performed using traditional dance steps. Traditional bhangra is now also performed on occasions other than during the harvest season.[10][11] According to Ganhar (1975), bhangra has been imported[12] into Jammu which is danced on Baisakhi. Other Punjabi folk dances such as giddhā and luḍḍī have also been imported into Jammu,[13][14][15][16][17] which shares Punjabi influences[18] however other view states that these dance forms have always been present in Jammu due to fact that Jammu as a part of greater Punjab region shares an affinity with current Punjab state.</p>
