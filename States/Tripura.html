  <img src="images\tripura.jpg" alt="Hojagiri Dance" width="400">
  <p>Hojagiri is a traditional dance form of the Reang community in Tripura, featuring acrobatic movements and balance skills, often performed by women on earthen pots or balancing plates.Hojagiri is a folk dance performed by young women of the Tripuri people of Reang clan.[9][10] It comprises four to six members in a team singing and balancing various objects or props on their head and hands, (such as a bottle or an earthen pitcher on the head; and lamps on the hands) while only moving the lower half of the body.Both men and women participate at harvest time in the Lebang Boomani dance. The men use bamboo clappers called tokkas[13] to set a beat while the women join them waving colorful scarves to catch the lebang (colorful insects of the region). The rhythmic play of the clappers is thought to attract the lebang out of their hiding places allowing the women to catch them.[14][15] The dance is accompanied by musical instruments like the flute, khamb, the percussion instrument known as a pung, and the sarinda. Women adorn themselves with silver chains, rings, and bangles; and a;so ear and nose rings made of bronze.</p>
