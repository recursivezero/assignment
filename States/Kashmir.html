      Rouf is a traditional dance form from Jammu and Kashmir, primarily performed by women during festivals such as Eid and during the harvesting season. This dance is known for its graceful footwork and rhythmic movements. Dancers perform in rows, creating a mesmerizing pattern while singing traditional folk songs.Rouf (pronounced ‘Ruf’) is one of the most well-known dance forms of Jammu and Kashmir. Decades ago, Rouf was also performed during the holy month of Ramadan to celebrate the beginning of the holy month and later to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha.

      Many in Kashmir Valley say that the Rouf dance is inspired by the bee and its movements towards and away from the bud. During the performance, a group of women stands facing each other. The most notable feature of this dance form is the footwork. Chakri, a sequence of complex foot steps, is one of the most significant attractions. Also, the song on which the dance is performed comprises one group asking questions and the other providing answers in song form. For example in a popular Rouf song, one group would sing: Eid aayi ras ras (Eid has arrived slowly and slowly). Another group replies by singing, Eidgah wase weyi (Let’s go to Eidgah).
      
      The women wear colourful pherans—loose woolen gowns—with silver jewellery to sing and perform the Rouf, bringing together neighbours and relatives.
