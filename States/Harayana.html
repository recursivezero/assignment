  <h1>Saang Dance - Haryana</h1>
  <img src="images\Haryana.jpeg" alt="Saang Dance" width="400">
  <p>Saang is a traditional folk dance from Haryana, performed as a narrative dance drama that involves humor, satire, and mythological stories. The dance is characterized by its vibrant costumes and lively music.Saang (Hindi: सांग), also known as Swang (meaning "imitiation")[1] or Svang (स्वांग), is a popular folk dance–theatre form in Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh.[2] Swang incorporates suitable theatrics and mimicry (or naqal) accompanied by song and dialogue. It is dialogue-oriented rather than movement-oriented. Religious stories and folk tales are enacted by a group of ten or twelve persons in an open area or an open-air theatre surrounded by the audience. Swang as an art of imitation means Rang-Bharna, Naqal-Karna.

    Swang can be considered as the most ancient folk theatre form in India. Nautanki, Saang, Tamasha originated from the Swang traditions. Old Swang traditions are:
    
    "EK MARDANA EK JANANA MANCH PAR ADE THE RAI"
    
    means one male and one female performers start the story.
    
    "EK SAARANGI EK DHOLAKIA SAATH MEIN ADE THE RAI"
    
    means one sarangi player and one dholak player joins the performance. This Swang/Saang performance was active at the time of Kabir Sant and Guru Nanak.
    
    Tradition credits Kishan Lal Bhaat for laying the foundation of the present style of Swang about two hundred years ago. During the Mughal period, and specifically at the time of the Aurangzeb, women were strictly banned from public performances. Since women did not participate in the dance-drama form, men have traditionally enacted their roles. Later on different performers changed the style according to the socio-political situations.

    Stage is similar to operatic performance. The stage may consist of a clear circular open area, or at the most, a wooden platform about three and a half metre in length. There are no elaborate stage arrangements similar to modern dramatic performances. There are no backdrops, curtains or green-rooms. Typically, there are no microphones or loudspeakers either. An hour or so before the show, the musicians of the orchestra begin to sing religious or other songs connected with the play in order to create the proper atmosphere for the play. The 'Guru' then appears and the artistes touch his feet to evoke his blessings. The play opens with a song ('bhait' or offering) in praise of Bhawani, the Goddess of Knowledge:
    
    Aa re bhawani baas kar mere ghat ke parde khol Rasna par basa karo maai shudh shabd mukh bol
    
    (Oh Goddess Bhawani, open the doors of knowledge to me. Bless my tongue so that all I sing consists of pure surs.)
    
    After Bhawani there are Chamolas, Kafias, Savias the main ingredients of performance. Googa Dhamoda a dance form starts at the beginning. With a brief introduction about the play, the performance starts. It consists mainly of mimicry, from which the name of the theater form derives (swaang means disguise or impersonation). Also featured prominently are long question and answer sessions between the actors. Much of the dialogue is improvised and the actors must be able to trade quotations, puns, proverbs and songs at the drop of a hat. There is much singing and dancing and there is always a clown character called the makhaulia (jester). Swang theatre is traditionally restricted to men, who also play the female roles, the latter often involving elaborate make-up and costumes. But female troupes are not altogether unknown.
    
    A single presentation of swaang may continue for up to five or six hours. There is much song and music, especially the famous Haryanvi style of singing known as Raagani.</p>
