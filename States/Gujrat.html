  <h1>Garba Dance - Gujarat</h1>
  <img src="images\Gujrat.jpg" alt="Garba Dance" width="400">
  <p>Garba is a lively dance form from Gujarat, often performed during the Navratri festival. Dancers form circles and dance with coordinated steps, creating an energetic and colorful atmosphere.Garba (Gujarati: ગરબા) is a form of Gujarati dance which originates from the state of Gujarat, India. The name is derived from the Sanskrit term Garbha .[1] Many traditional garbas are performed around a centrally lit lamp or a picture or statue of the Hindu goddess Durga. Traditionally, it is performed during the nine-day Hindu festival Navaratri (Gujarati: નવરાત્રી, where નવ means 9, and રાત્રી means nights). Either the lamp (the Garba Deep) or an image of the Goddess, Durga (also called Amba) is placed in the middle of concentric rings as an object of veneration.The word garba comes from the Sanskrit word for womb and so implies gestation or pregnancy — life. Traditionally, the dance is performed around a clay lantern with a light inside, called a Garbha Deep ("womb lamp"). This lantern represents life, and the fetus in the womb in particular. The dancers thus honor Durga, the feminine form of divinity.

    Garba is performed in a circle as a symbol of the Hindu view of time. The rings of dancers revolve in cycles, as time in Hindu is cyclical. As the cycle of time revolve, from birth, to life, to death and again to rebirth, the only thing that is constant is the Goddess, that one unmoving symbol in the midst of all of this unending and infinite movement. The dance symbolizes that God, represented in feminine form in this case, is the only thing that remains unchanging in a constantly changing universe (jagat).
    
    The Garbha Deep has another symbolic interpretation. The vessel itself is a symbol of the body, within whom Divinity (in the form of the Goddess) resides. Garba is danced around this symbol to honour the fact that all humans have the Divine energy of Devi within them.</p>
