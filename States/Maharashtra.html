  <p>Lavani is a traditional dance form of Maharashtra, known for its rhythm and sensuality. It is performed to the beats of the dholak, with performers wearing traditional nine-yard sarees.Lavani (Marathi: लावणी) is a genre of music popular in Maharashtra, India.[1] Lavani is a combination of traditional song and dance, which particularly performed to the beats of Dholki, a percussion instrument. Lavani is noted for its powerful rhythm. Lavani has contributed substantially to the development of Marathi folk theatre.[2] In Maharashtra and southern Madhya Pradesh it is performed by the female performers wearing nine-yard long sarees also called Lugade saree. The songs are sung in a quick tempoTraditionally, this genre of folk dance deals with different and varied subject matters such as society, religion and politics. The songs in 'Lavani' are mostly emotional in sentiment and the dialogues tend to be pungent in socio-political satire.[5] Originally, it was used as a form of entertainment and morale booster to the tired soldiers. Lavani Songs, which are sung along with dance, are usually naughty and erotic in nature. It is believed their origin is in the Prakrit Gathas collected by Hala.[6] The Nirguni Lavani (philosophical) and the Shringari Lavani (sensual) are the two types. The devotional music of the Nirguni cult is popular all over Malwa.

    Lavani developed into two distinct performances, namely Phadachi Lavani and Baithakichi Lavani. The Lavani sung and enacted in a public performance before a large audience in a theatrical atmosphere is called Phadachi Lavani and all the Tamasha Troupe (phad) in Maharastra present it as one of its main sections. Lavani poet Bashir Momin Kavathekar had written Lavani's extensively for Tamasha Troups of Maharshtra during the late twentieth century.[7] And, when the Lavani is sung in a closed chamber for a private and select audience by a girl sitting before the audience, it came to be known as Baithakichi Lavani. Notably, it is a kind of Mujra strictly performed for men and away from the village with no access for ladies or families to watch. The songs were written in sexually explicit double meaning.</p>
