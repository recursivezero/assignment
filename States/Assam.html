  <img src="images/assam.jpg" alt="Bihu Dance" width="400">
  <p>The Bihu dance is an indigenous folk dance from the Indian state of Assam related to the Bihu festival and an important part of Assamese culture. Performed in a group, the Bihu dancers are usually young men and women, and the dancing style is characterized by brisk steps and rapid hand movements. The traditional costume of dancers is centered around the red color theme, signifying joy and vigour.The origins of the dance lies in ethnic groups, such as Deoris, Sonowal Kacharis, Morans, Chutias, Boros, Rabhas, and Borahis, among others.[1] According to scholars, the Bihu dance has its origins in ancient fertility cults that were associated with increasing the fertility of the population as well as the land.[2] Traditionally, local farming communities performed the dance outdoors, in fields, groves, forests or on the banks of rivers, especially under the fig tree.[3][4]

    Bihu is mentioned in the inscriptions of the 14th-century Chutia King Lakshminaryan as well.The dance begins with the performers, young men and women, slowly walking into the performance space.[5] The men then start playing musical instruments, like drums (particularly the double-headed dhol), horn-pipes and flutes, while the women place their hands above their hips with their palms facing outwards, forming an inverted triangular shape.[6] The women then start to slowly move in tune with the music by swaying, while bending slightly forward from the waist. Gradually, they open up their shoulders and place their legs slightly apart, adopting the main posture used in the Bihu dance. Meanwhile, the music played by the men picks up in temp, leading women to thrust forward their breasts and pelvis, alternatively, to the tune.</p>
