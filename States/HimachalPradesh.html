  <img src="images\himachal.jpg" alt="Nati Dance" width="400">
  <p>Nati is a popular folk dance of Himachal Pradesh, characterized by graceful hand movements and performed during festivals and celebrations. It is often danced in groups by both men and women.The word Nati is used for the traditional folk dance in the Western and Central Hills of the Indian subcontinent. It is primarily native to the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Nati is traditionally performed in the Kullu, Mandi, Shimla, Sirmaur, Chamba, Kinnaur, Uttarkashi, Dehradun (Jaunsar-Bawar) and Tehri Garhwal districts. However, due to high immigration of ethnic paharis in the plains, this has been made popular in the plains too. Traditionally, locals dance to the beats of percussion instruments called Dhol-Damau. Pahari dance is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as largest folk dance.There are several varieties of Nati performed like Kullvi Nati, Mahasuvi Nati, Sirmauri Nati, Kinnauri Nati, Jaunpuri Nati, Barada Nati, Bangani Nati. In Garhwali it is also sometimes called Tandi, specially in Tehri Garhwal, and Barada Nati in Jaunsar-Bawar. People of Lahaul district have their own distinct dance called "Garphi" and Nati is not a part of Lahauli culture.[1] The Kinnauri Nati dance is mime-like and includes languid sequences.The Nati Dance in the second week of January 2016 was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest folk dance in the world. Nati entered in the book as the largest folk dance in terms of participantsâ€™ number. Total 9892 women participated in this folk dance in their traditional colourful Kullvi dress on 26 October 2015 during International Dussehra festival.</p>
