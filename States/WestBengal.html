  <img src="images\westbengal.jpg" alt="Chhau Dance" width="400">
  <p>Chhau is a vibrant, martial dance form popular in West Bengal. Known for its elaborate masks and energetic moves, it portrays mythological stories through dance and drama.Chhau, also spelled Chhou, is a semi classical Indian dance with martial and folk traditions.[1] It is found in three styles named after the location where they are performed, i.e. the Purulia Chhau of West Bengal, the Seraikella Chhau of Jharkhand and the Mayurbhanj Chhau of Odisha.

    The dance ranges from celebrating martial arts, acrobatics and athletics performed in festive themes of a folk dance, to a structured dance with religious themes found in Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism. The costumes vary between the styles, with Purulia and Serakeilla using masks to identify the character.[2] The stories enacted by Chhau dancers include those from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Puranas and other Indian literature.[2][3]
    
    The dance is traditionally an all males troupe, regionally celebrated particularly during spring every year, and may be a syncretic dance form that emerged from a fusion of classical Hindu dances and the traditions of ancient regional tribes.[3] The dance brings together people from diverse socio-economic backgrounds in a festive and religious spirit.The Chhau dance is mainly performed during festivals in the region of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha, especially the spring festival of Chaitra Parva and in which the whole community participates.[5] The Purulia Chhau dance is celebrated during the Sun festival.[8]


    Artists from the Purulia district of West Bengal perform the Chhau dance
    Masks form an integral part of Chhau dance in Purulia and Seraikella styles.[2] The knowledge of dance, music and mask-making is transmitted orally.[9] The Chhau dance found in northern Odisha does not use masks during the dance, but they do when the artists first appear on the stage for introduction to the audience.[10]
    
    The two styles of Chhau dance that use masks, blend within it forms of both dance and martial practices employing mock combat techniques (called khel), stylised gaits of birds and animals (called chalis and topkas) and movements based on the chores of village housewives (called uflis).[8] This form of the Chhau dance, states Mohan Khokar, has no ritual or ceremonial meaning, it is a form of community celebration and entertainment.</p>
