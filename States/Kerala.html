  <p>Kathakali is a classical dance-drama from Kerala, renowned for its elaborate costumes, makeup, and storytelling. It combines dance, music, and acting to depict ancient Indian epics and folklore.The fully developed style of Kathakali originated around the 16th century, but its roots are in the temple and folk arts (such as Krishnanattam and religious drama of the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut) of the southwestern Indian peninsula, which are traceable to at least the 1st millennium CE.[1][5] A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India.[1][2][4] Kathakali also differs in that the structure and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike other classical Indian dances which primarily developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools.[1][5][citation needed]

    The traditional themes of the Kathakali are folk stories, religious legends and spiritual ideas from the Hindu epics and the Puranas.[6] The vocal performance has traditionally been performed in Sanskritised Malayalam.[5] In modern compositions, Indian Kathakali troupes have included women artistes,[3] and adapted Western stories and plays such as those by Shakespeare.[7] In 2011, a performance expressing Christian doctrine was staged for the first time in Kerala.Elements and aspects of Kathakali are taken from ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra.[11] The Natya Shastra is attributed to sage Bharata, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BC and 200 AD,[12][13] but estimates vary between 500 BC and 500 AD.[14]

    The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters.[12][15] The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures–all of which are part of Indian classical dances including Kathakali.[11][12][16] Dance and performance arts, states this ancient Hindu text,[17] are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.[18]
    
    The roots of Kathakali are unclear. Jones and Ryan state it is more than 500 years old. Kathakali emerged as a distinct genre of performance art during the 16th and 17th centuries in Kerala.[19] The roots of Kathakali, states Mahinder Singh, are more ancient and some 1500 years old.</p>
