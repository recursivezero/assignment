# **Internship Assignment: AI/ML-Based Image Search Feature**

**Position:** Engineering Intern (AI/ML)  
**Duration:** 7 Days  
**Submission:** GitHub

## **Objective**

Develop an **AI/ML-powered image search feature** that allows users to upload an image and retrieve visually similar images from a dataset. The solution should leverage machine learning models for feature extraction and similarity matching.

### **Key Tasks**

1. **Dataset Acquisition**

   - Download a suitable image dataset from **Kaggle** (e.g., [Fashion-MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist), [CIFAR-10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/cifar10-python-in-csv), or any relevant dataset).
   - Preprocess the dataset (resize, normalize, augment if needed).

2. **Feature Extraction with AI/ML**

   - Use a **pre-trained CNN model** (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet) to extract image embeddings.
   - Implement a feature vector database (can use **FAISS, Annoy, or Scikit-learnâ€™s Nearest Neighbors** for efficient search).

3. **Similarity Search Implementation**

   - Build a function that takes an input image and returns the top **N most similar images** from the dataset.
   - Use **cosine similarity or Euclidean distance** for matching.

4. **User Interface (Optional but Recommended)**

   - Develop a simple **Flask/FastAPI** backend to upload images and display results.
   - (Bonus) Create a basic **Streamlit/React frontend** for interaction.

5. **Optimization & Evaluation**
   - Measure search accuracy (e.g., Precision@K).
   - Optimize for speed (reduce search latency).

### **Deliverables (Submit via GitHub)**

âœ… **GitHub Repository** with:

- Well-documented code (README.md with setup instructions).
- Jupyter Notebook / Python script for model training & testing.
- Backend API code (if applicable).
- Sample test images & output examples.

### **Tech Stack Suggestions**

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, FAISS/Annoy
- **Backend (Optional):** Flask/FastAPI
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

### **Evaluation Criteria**

âœ” **Functionality** (Does the search work accurately?)  
âœ” **Code Quality** (Clean, modular, well-documented)  
âœ” **Performance** (Speed vs. accuracy trade-offs)  
âœ” **Innovation** (Any extra features like filters, UI improvements)

---

**Submission Deadline:** A week from Today.

## Note

Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks you find suitable for the image processing and recognition and UI development. The goal is to create a functional and well-documented application that meets the specified requirements.

**Good Luck!** ðŸš€ Letâ€™s build something awesome!
