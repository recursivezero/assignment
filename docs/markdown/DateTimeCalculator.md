# Internship Assignment: Date & Time Calculator

## Objective

Assess the candidate's proficiency in **JavaScript date handling**, **Intl API**, and UI/UX development by creating an interactive date calculator that calculates age, date differences, and future dates.

## Assignment Overview

Create a **web-based date and time calculator** that allows users to:

1. **Select a Date and Time** to calculate age or the difference between two dates.
2. **View the difference** between two selected dates in **years, months, and days**.
3. **Calculate future or past dates** (e.g., what date will it be **1000 days from today**).
4. **Display the current date and time** at the top using **JavaScript's Intl.DateTimeFormat API**.

The UI should be interactive and **user-friendly**, utilizing **smooth animations** for a modern experience.
