# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

The tool should represent a caste family tree with 72 nodes, where each node represents a primary family branch. Upon clicking on a node, it should expand to show the surnames associated with that branch, along with their respective deity and gotra information.

## How it works

There are JSON file under *assets/json* folder, which contains information about different branches of Indian families, their Gotras (ancestral lineage), associated deities, and common surnames.

Each entry includes:

- Branch Name: The name of the family branch.
- Gotra: The ancestral lineage associated with the branch.
- Deity: The deity that the branch worships.
- Surnames: A list of common surnames associated with the branch.

example json

```json
[
  {
      "Branch_Name": "base name",
      "Gotra": "gotra name",
      "Deity": "gotra deity",
      "Location": "gotra origin",
      "Surnames": [
        "surname 1", "surname2"
      ]
  },
]
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
